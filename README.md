The "RoomHumidityMonitorAPI" repository is a home automation web service designed for storing and retrieving humidity data from various rooms in your house. This service enables the creation of an API that allows temperature sensors to transmit data, which can then be accessed or processed as required.

This project utilizes Flask, a Python-based web framework, to construct a RESTful API capable of receiving and storing incoming humidity data. The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, offering a robust and scalable solution for handling substantial amounts of data.

By exploring this repository, you can acquire insights into building a straightforward Flask API integrated with PostgreSQL for data storage. Additionally, you'll gain experience in working with RESTful APIs, a widely used method for data exchange between web applications.

While this project doesn't involve Arduinos, it lays a strong foundation for creating home automation projects centered around humidity sensors. Establishing a home automation web service allows easy monitoring and tracking of humidity levels in different rooms, contributing to the maintenance of a comfortable living environment.

The code within this repository is crafted for clarity and adaptability, serving as an excellent starting point for individuals keen on developing their own home automation projects using Flask and PostgreSQL.
